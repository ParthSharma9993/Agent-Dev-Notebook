# ðŸ§  Agent Development Kit (ADK) Playground

Welcome to my **Agent Development Kit (ADK) Playground** â€” a learning-focused repository built using **Python**, where I explore and implement various types of AI agents.

This repository is designed as a practical guide and sandbox for understanding how different agent architectures work. From sequential to parallel agents, and from callback-based logic to multi-agent collaboration, this project showcases both foundational and experimental agent designs.

## ðŸ§© Overview

This repository contains working examples and experimentation around intelligent agents using a modular and extensible approach. The goal is to understand agent reasoning, control flow, communication, and integration with tools and APIs.

These agents are implemented using **Python** and integrate concepts such as:
- Sequential task execution
- Event-driven callbacks
- Tool-enhanced reasoning
- State sharing and memory
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Lightweight integration with LiteLLM
